# API URL Generator

After writing a few RESTful APIs with Rails, I was always running into issues with generating URL for my resources. Either, I would try to force `url_for` or `path_to` to work, but it was never ideal. Since, I couldn't find anyother solutions, I decide to write my own. This gem helps create urls for your RESTful API to make it easier for client applications to navigate without using `ActionView::Helpers`

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'api_url_generator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install api_url_generator
